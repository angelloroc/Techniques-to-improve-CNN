# Techniques-to-improve-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular deep learning approach for computer vision tasks. To improve the performance of CNNs, techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and transfer learning can be used.

### Data augmentation 
This involves generating new training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. This technique can help to increase the variety and amount of training data, which can improve the network's generalization ability.

### Dropout
This a regularization technique that randomly sets a portion of the neurons to zero during training. This technique can prevent overfitting and improve the network's generalization ability.

### Transfer learning
This involves using a pre-trained CNN as a starting point and fine-tuning it on a new dataset. This technique can reduce the amount of training required and improve performance, especially when the new dataset is small or similar to the original dataset used for pre-training.
